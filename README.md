Backend for existing website.
CRUD application transmitting API for angular project and saving data in MySQL.
File formats (.jpg, .png)  are  saved in blob - I know that it is not a good solution but for now it is for practice - in future, this solution will be changed into saving files in local folder and the paths of these files formats will be stored in MySQL.
Repozitory is still being expanded, ultimately application will be converted into sping MVC (for education) and amazon AWS for storing the data.
