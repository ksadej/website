Backend for existing website.
CRUD application transmitting API for angular project and saving data in MySQL.
File formats (.jpg, .png)  are  saved in blob - I know that it is not a good solution but for now it is for practice - in future, this solutionin will be changed in to saving files in local folder and the paths of these files formats will be stored in MySQL.
Repozitory is still being expanded, ultimately application will be converted in to sping MVC and amazon AWS for the data.
